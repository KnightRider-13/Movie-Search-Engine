## Code Highlights

### 1. Main Movie Search Logic
```javascript
async function main(keyword){
    const promise = await fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=af3cb781&s=${keyword}`);
    const moviesData = await promise.json();
    movies = moviesData.Search.slice(0, 6);
    filteringMovies(movies, filter);
    if(movies){
        movieContainer.innerHTML = movies.map(movie => movieHtml(movie)).join("");
    }
    else{
        movieContainer.classList += " no-movies";
        movieContainer.innerHTML = "<h3>No Movies Found</h3>";
    }
}
```
### 2. Sorting Logic
```javascript
function filteringMovies(movies, filter){
    if(filter === "NEW_TO_OLD"){
        movies.sort((a, b) => (b.Year - a.Year));
    }
    else if(filter === "OLD_TO_NEW"){
        movies.sort((a, b) => (a.Year - b.Year));
    }
    movieContainer.innerHTML = movies.map(movie => movieHtml(movie)).join("");
}
```
